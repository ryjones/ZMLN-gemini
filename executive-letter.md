### **A Message from Our Executive Director**

**To our Fellow Stakeholders, Maintainers, and Corporate Overlords:**

When I joined the Linux Foundation, the prevailing wisdom was that you couldn't herd cats. I spent the next two decades proving that while you can't herd them, you *can* build a very expensive, high-end enclosure, provide premium kibba sponsored by IBM and Google, and convince the cats that staying inside the enclosure is "industry standard."

Zemlincoin is that enclosure, but with better liquidity.

For years, we have operated on the "Plumbing Paradox": the more essential a piece of code is to the global economy, the less likely anyone is to pay for its upkeep. We’ve solved this through sheer force of will and a lot of frequent flyer miles. But "will" doesn't scale. Code does.

Zemlincoin represents the final abstraction of open source. We are moving from a "Contribution Model" to a "Capitalized Maintenance Model." We are effectively turning "free as in speech" into "free as in highly-leveraged financial instrument."

Some critics—mostly people still using IRC—will say that putting a price on a pull request destroys the spirit of the community. To them, I say: Have you seen the price of housing in San Francisco? You can't pay a mortgage with "community spirit," but you *can* potentially use $ZMLN as collateral for a decentralized loan.

We are building a future where the "World’s Most Important Software" isn't just a hobby; it’s a blue-chip asset class. I invite you to join us, stake your tokens, and remember: if it’s not in the main branch, it doesn't exist.

Warmly,

**Jim Zemlin**
