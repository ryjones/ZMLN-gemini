### **Zemlincoin (ZMLN) | Prospectus Summary**

#### **Section 4.2: Risk Factors**

Investing in Zemlincoin involves a high degree of risk. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment, your commit access, and possibly your dignity.

**1. The "Bus Factor" Risk**
The value of ZMLN is intrinsically tied to the continued health and diplomatic stamina of Jim Zemlin. If Jim decides to retire to a quiet life of artisanal sourdough baking or, heaven forbid, starts wearing hoodies instead of tailored blazers, the "Executive Premium" baked into the token’s price will collapse. There is currently no secondary market for Jim-level corporate diplomacy.

**2. The Linus Volatility Index (LVI)**
While Jim manages the Foundation, the underlying "hash power" of the ecosystem is driven by the Linux kernel community. We cannot guarantee that a particularly spicy email from Linus Torvalds regarding a broken memory controller won't cause a 40% flash-crash in ZMLN. The protocol includes a "Chill Out" circuit breaker, but it has not been tested against a direct "NACK" from the BDFL.

**3. Forks, Hard and Soft**
In traditional finance, a "stock split" is a neutral event. In open source, a "fork" is a theological war. If a faction of developers decides to launch **Zemlincoin Classic (ZMLC)**—which is exactly the same but uses a licensing model written in Esperanto—the liquidity of your ZMLN may vanish into a black hole of GitHub Issues.

**4. Regulatory "Common Sense"**
Jim often speaks about "harmonizing global standards." The SEC often speaks about "injunctions." There is a significant risk that regulators will view the "Proof-of-Governance" mechanism as an unregistered voting trust. If the government decides that a "merged PR" is actually a "derivative contract," we are all going to spend a lot of time in depositions.
